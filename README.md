# Requirements

Our website will have people to sign their clinic up, and after it gets verified that it is not a scam, we add them into the database giving them the ability to use the system. First of all we will have a manager that will add doctors and secretaries.

Doctors will be responsible to add the prescription for a patient on the system and submit it into the patient record, and in the future we plan on making it also printed by a printer when the doctor submits the prescription.

Secretaries will be responsible for registering patients and checking their prescriptoins if needed. She will have access on the schedules of all doctors and reservations.
